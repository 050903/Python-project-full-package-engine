# Super ElonMusk AI Decision Matrix

Welcome to the Super ElonMusk AI Decision Matrix – a futuristic AI-powered Scenario Engine designed to simulate all relevant outcomes of any real-world situation and guide you to optimal decisions.

## 🎯 Core Principles

-   **Think like Elon Musk**: Simplify problems to first principles.
-   **Elegance & Extensibility**: Designed for clarity and future growth.
-   **Shockingly Smart**: Aims to provide deep insights (actual smartness depends on the integrated LLM).
-   **Code for Future Civilizations**: Built with clarity and longevity in mind.

## ✨ Features

-   Natural language scenario input.
-   AI-generated intelligent clarification questions.
-   Decision tree generation simulating possible outcomes.
-   Action ranking based on: feasibility, impact, cost, time, safety, and innovation.
-   Reasoning provided for each recommendation.
-   Interactive decision tree visualization.
-   Export options: JSON, Markdown, PDF.

## 🚀 Setup & Run

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or create the files as specified.**
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: For advanced tree layouts with `pygraphviz`, you might need to install Graphviz system-wide first. See `pygraphviz` documentation.*
4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 🤖 AI Integration (Placeholder Notice)

The current version uses placeholder AI functions within the `core` modules. These simulate AI behavior to demonstrate the application's workflow. To unlock true "shockingly smart" capabilities, these placeholders should be replaced with calls to advanced Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, or local models via LangChain. Look for `_query_llm_...` style functions or comments indicating "AI Integration Point".

## 🔧 Future Enhancements (Optional Plugins)

The system is designed with extensibility in mind for features like:
-   Voice input.
-   Team decision mode.
-   AI self-adaptation and learning.
-   Integration with real-time data feeds.
