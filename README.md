## 🧭 **Usage Tips**

To effectively explore and utilize these projects, consider the following recommendations:

* **Read `README` files:** Always check each project's `README` file for detailed setup instructions, usage guidelines, and specific project information.
* **Virtual Environments:** It is highly recommended to activate virtual environments before running any code to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
* **Machine Learning Projects:** For projects involving Machine Learning (ML), look for common directories like `data/` (for raw data), `models/` (for trained ML models), and sometimes `notebooks/` (for Jupyter notebooks used in development or analysis).
* **GUI/Web Applications:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) or web applications typically have dedicated directories such as `app/`, `gui/`, or `frontend/`.
* **Game Projects:** Most game projects will have a `main.py` file that serves as the primary entry point for running the game.
